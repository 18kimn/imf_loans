# The IMF intervention

- brings Asian nations close to modernity,
- through crisis, shows they will forever be outside of it,
- through placement, denigrating other nonwhite nations

# What is the IMF?

- A fund, with $940 billion in its coffers
- but through structural adjustment programs, much more
  - convincing investment banks to "roll over" loans
  - making sure its loans can be repaid
  - fulfilling economic needs of Global North countries
- austerity, but also more raw exports, opening up to foreign
  investment

---

# The Asian Financial Crisis: Importance

- More lending than ever before
- More policies than ever before
- The IMF had fully matured, especially with its policies it imposed
- The recreation of racial hierarchy was set it stone by this crisis

---

# The Asian Financial Crisis: How it happened

- **1980s**: Foreign investment pours into Asia; Asian economies do
  phenomenally to Western eyes
- **1990s**: US dollar catches up quickly in value
  - Asian currencies pegged to the US dollar lag, and their exports
    especially become more expensive. Debts build up.
- **Throughout 1997**: Investors panic. The peg forces countries to
  float their currencies. Investors panic more. Loan rollover stops.
- **Fall 1997**: Financial crisis. Investors keep panicking.

# Korea and intervention

- $55 billion total bailout package from IMF
- GDP and government spending both shrink 8%
- suspension of nine banks
- removal of foreign investment caps, foreign access to domestic
  tools, foreign access to establish financial institutions in Korea

# the crisis' conclusion

- Millions of workers laid off
- Worker and union protections not reinstated until many years later
- "Crackdown" on Korean companies exactly successful; often mergers
  just created larger corporations
- Korean debt to foreign institutions increased, not decreased, as a
  result of the crisis

---

> The close cooperation between Korea and the IMF over the last few
> years has been exemplary and in many respects serves as a model for
> other countries. We are confident that with your strong leadership
> Korea will successfully continue to restructure its economy to meet
> the challenges that still lie ahead. Rest assured that the IMF will,
> for its part, cooperate closely with the Government of Korea in its
> future endeavors.

-- Horst Kohler, Managing Director of the IMF. August 22, 2001

# Racialization

- It's not about "good economics" but about foreign opinion
  - predicted a crisis, and then made a crisis
  - rescue was dependent on restoring foreign confidence
- Not objective or rational, but _racial_
  - "miracle of Asian success" that was in fact a ruse
  - lifts up, pushes down; places Korea as proximate to but outside of
    modernity
  - models of development for the nonwhite world
