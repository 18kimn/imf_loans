My thesis seeks to explore the _racial logic_ of the IMF's structural adjustment
programs (SAPs). My main contention is that the IMF uses SAPs to unite countries
into a global racial hierarchy, enabled in part by the "model modernity" status
conferred to countries like Korea upholds this.

My main focus is on South Korea's experience during the Asian financial crisis.
I draw from Marxist/neo-Marxist frameworks of racialized accumulation by
dispossession, as well as the earlier lineage of dependency and world-systems
theories, to show how SAPs reentrenched Korea in the conditions that brought on
the crisis. In a broader sense, I will argue that SAPs uphold not just an
economic but also profoundly racial international hierarchy.
