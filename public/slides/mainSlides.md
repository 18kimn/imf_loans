- Capitalism is accumulation
- Marx: Accumulation begins with violence (dispossession)
- [David Harvey's _The New Imperialism_ (2003)](https://eatonak.org/IPE501/downloads/files/New%20Imperialism.pdf)
- A turn towards the social processes of capitalism

From dispossessive start for economic process, to a process that is
**continually dispossessive.**

- Ferreira da Silva and Chakravartty (2012)
- Harvey tries to turn from "primitive" to ongoing social processes
  - but leaves race as a coincidental, preexisting category
- Others: Lorenzo Veracini, Ania Loomba, Max Haiven, Gargi Bhattacharyya

# 2: history

---

## the Asian financial crisis

- **1980s**: Southeast Asia had a ton of foreign investment
- **1990s**: US dollar catches up quickly in value
  - This makes Asian exports more expensive (because of the peg)
- **Throughout 1997**: The peg forces Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea to float
  their currencies
- **Late 1997**: Financial crisis

---

## IMF Intervenes

- "structural adjustment programs" that accompany loans
- blame on corporations in Asia
- removal of all caps on foreign investment and ownership
- "labor market flexibility"

## part 3: my thesis: Korea: history+theory

- Korea responded a lot
  - Korea implemented more than necessary
  - IMF notes that Korea "has been exemplary and in many respects serves as a
    model for other countries."
  - **model modernity produced by and produces racial hierarchy**
- This isn't just an economic crisis, but a cultural one
  - Scholars note a rightward shift during this era
  - This is culturally known as the "IMF era"

Emblematic of the IMF's "colorblind" logic permeating and uniting all into a
single system, that differentiates each into their own places in the global
racial hierarchy.

---

## Research questions

- For the case of South Korea, how does _race_ specifically become a relevant
  category in acquiring a bailout from the IMF?
- How does the IMF's relationship with South Korea, a nation cast into a status
  of "model modernity," compare with the IMF's relationship with other
  countries?

**What is the racial logic undergirding the IMF intervention in Korea?**
