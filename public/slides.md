- Ferreira da Silva and Chakravartty (2012)
- Harvey tries to turn from "primitive" to ongoing social processes
  - but leaves race as a coincidental, preexisting category

# 2: history

--- 

# the Asian financial crisis

- 1980s: Southeast Asia had a ton of foreign investment
- 1990s: US dollar catches up quickly in value
- This makes Asian exports more expensive (because of the peg)
- The peg forces Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea to float their currencies
- Financial crisis

---

# intervention

- blame on corporations in Asia
- removal of all caps on foreign investment and ownership
- "labor market flexibility"

---

# part 3: my thesis: Korea: history+theory

- Korea responded a lot 
  - Korea actually implemented more than necessary
  - IMF notes that Korea "has been exemplary and in many respects serves as a model for other countries."
- This isn't just an economic crisis, but a cultural one
  - Scholars note a rightward shift during this era 
  - This is culturally known as the "IMF era"
