I read some of this stuff last semester, and started thinking through it, and
there were some spots where it could definitely be expanded:

- global nature
- other crises besides 2008
- how does that racial logic function

---

(history)

- if I had an banana valued at $1 today, but the US dollar is being pumped up in
  value so that tomorrow this price of $1 actually represents $10, nobody will
  want to buy my banana

---

- model modernity
  - racial hierarchy made this, this makes racial hierarchy
  - universalizing - differentiating

as important as the actual events that led to the crisis actually are, what I am
much more interested in explaining and understanding and making a thesis about
is the logic behind all of this

- if that doesn't make sense, it's because I have no idea what I'm talking about
- pictures sometimes are better than words

in the midst of my thesis i have become frustrated and have been searching for a
better way to do scholarship. one that opens up the humanities, from being
focused on a canon, from providing little new theory and being scholarship for
the sake of scholarship, from being distributed in the same inaccessible
mediums,

I want a humanities for everybody, a humanities for the public instead of a
humanities limited by the all of the walls in the ivory tower. In the process,
in the theory, in the methods, in the sources, in the conclusions -- all of
these should point outwards. The arbitrary divisions that structure each of them
have to be torn down. We need to open up the humanities.

These are some reflections on how I am doing this project in this pursuit. In
this project, they have boiled down so far to four claims:

1. Accessible tools
2. Accessible products
3. Accessible processes
4. Accessible presentations

Or to state it in a single sentence, _we should open up the humanities_.

### we should document the process

Theoretically: Writing a history is itself a historical event. When I'm writing
about the IMF and the Asian financial crisis, what is relevant are not the
events of 1997, but also the thoughts and notes I am writing right now in 2021.
The historian is very much implicated in the process of creating history,
because history is not only those that "do the events" but also the ones that
make these events knowable and known to others.

This is a statement every historian and scholar in the humanties can agree with,
but still the process of writing history is not one that in my view is treated
as a history. We should be creating and documenting archives while we write. We
should be reflecting, self-critiquing, tracking.

Morally: Writing a history right now occurs by one person one their computer,
typing away on microsoft word. The process of writing history is locked in the
ivory tower, to only those academicians and putting these characters on the
page. It's impossible to see the development of research from outside this. We
need the documentation of the process as it happens right now.

Conclusion: we should document, journal, log our own processes and how they come
to be; and through all of this make it freely accessible and

### we should use freely accessible resources to make research

### we should make our resources freely accessible

### we should use more accessible mediums of presentation

We have coalesced to a defined canon of presentation as well
