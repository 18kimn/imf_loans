# Conclusion

If the IMF wishes us to learn one thing from the two crises,
it's that there's no alternative but to be incorporated into
"free market" capitalism and the interventionist logic of the
IMF. It's to believe that there was no alternative for U.S.
creditors but to pull out in the face of what appeared to be an
impending crash, that there was no alternative for the IMF but
to impose unprecedented economic burdens on Korea, that there
was no alternative but for Kim Dae-Jung's administration to
accept and begrudgingly implement these restrictions in order
for foreign investors to return. To believe that as painful as
they were, these steps were ultimately necessary to save Korea
from a precipitous fall.

I hope to push back on this defeatist perspective, through
deconstructing and exposing the above arguments as disingenous
and a cover for the logic for the same racial hierarchy of old,
but also by pointing to alternatives to neverending reformism.

[hm, need to find examples of imf / world bank instead of us
political interests only] It is still an obvious truism that
U.S. political interests are able to be upheld thanks to the
power of its financial institutions, a relationship that hurts
most during times of crises and often crippling instead of
serving countries in need. One might think of the U.S.
sanctioning the French bank BNP Paribas for $8.9 billion in
2014 for dealing with U.S. enemies Sudan, Iran, and Cuba, a
move that was only possible because BNP Paribas relied on U.S.
institutions to store and move money.^[Most notably this
includes the Fedwire system to process and validate large
payments like the kinds, which is operated by the United States
Federal Reserve.] More recently, one can refer to the Biden
Administration's unilateral decision to freeze $9 billion owned
by the Afghanistan central bank but held in U.S. institutions
and therefore subject to the whims of the current regime.
Neither of these events occurred through any international law,
but because of the reliance the world has on U.S. banks.

But alternatives do exist. Russia and many countries in Asia
have been moving towards relying on a basket of currencies to
set the value of their own and to use in their national
reserves, moving away from the fragile reliance on the dollar
that led to financial ruin for Thailand and Indonesia
especially. China's Belt and Road Initiative has taken massive
shape [wording] over the past decade, accounting for upwards of
a trillion dollars of investment across nearly every continent
and presenting a major departure from the pattern of financing
from U.S. banks that preceded it.

For world leaders, these trends

While on a trip to form an economic partnership with Russia and
join the Belt and Road Initiative, Argentinian President
Alberto Fernandez commented to Russian President Vladmir Putin:

Questions remain on whether the kinds of changes, however large
or dramatic they might appear, are sustainably moving the world
away from U.S. financial hegemony. El Salvador's move to
Bitcoin as its national currency, a move made partially for its
practical benefits like avoiding remittance fees from overseas
banks and lower management cost, and partially for the
conceptual freedom afforded to El Salvador when they are freed
from relying on other countries' markets to price their own
currency. The IMF has strongly condemned this move, with the
stated belief that

Regardless of this,

  - scholarly criticism of the IMF is not a dearth at all, and
    I'd even go as far as to say that it's generally accepted
    that the IMF did not properly support countries in Asia,
    and that the crisis erupted out of misguided foreign
    speculation
