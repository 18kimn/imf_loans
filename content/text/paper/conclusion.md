# Conclusion

- quote about the korean worker's rebellion to start ?

  - at least to illustrate that no celebrity will save Korea

- if the IMF wishes us to learn one thing from the two crises,
  it's that there's no alternative but to be incorporated into
  free market capitalism, and the interventionist logic of the
  IMF

  - even the radical in korea embraced them

- but people in fact fight back and push back
  - scholarly criticism of the IMF is not a dearth at all, and
    I'd even go as far as to say that it's generally accepted
    that the IMF did not properly support countries in Asia,
    and that the crisis erupted out of misguided foreign
    speculation
