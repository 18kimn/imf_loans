# Introduction

Since its founding in 1944, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has amassed a total of 705 billion Special Drawing Rights
in spending capacity, or about \$1 trillion. This spending
capacity is deployed as loans during times of crisis, compared
to the World Bank's extensive general lending system. Through
these loans, relatively small Washington-based organization (of
only \~2,300 staff members) with no subsidiary organizations is
able to move the global economy, millions of people at a time.
Its focus on low-to-middle-income countries during crises means
that the most vulnerable of the global population are affected
by its work.

The IMF's loans are not without caveats. Under the stated
purpose of ensuring loan repayment and financial stability, or
"conditionality," the IMF requires that loan-receiving
countries also implement a set of macroeconomic policy reforms
known as Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs). These include
"purely" economic measures like currency devaluation, austerity
measures, and restructuring or refinancing foreign debts, but
also include liberalization of markets broadly, privatization
of state-owned companies in particular, opening the country to
foreign investment, and a stipulation for the country to move
towards resource extraction and export. Although the majority
of IMF loans do come with market-rate interest rates and often
require collateral, both of which can be a significant burden
for countries requesting aid, SAPs are far more powerful in
terms of creating long-term subjugating economic relations.
SAPs push countries in the Global South to cheaply produce and
export goods to the Global North, where only then they are
realized as profit.[This is the main subject of
@smithImperialismTwentyFirstCentury2016] SAPs push countries to
denationalize basic necessities and turn them over to
multinational corporations in order to qualify for loans.[See
@ciafoneEndowingNeoliberalUniversity2005 for a detailed history
on Yale's relationship with privatizing Indonesian power.] In
more direct terms, SAPs push countries into a recapitulated
racial hierarchy, a new imperialism, an imperialism for the
twenty-first century.[@harveyNewImperialism2003;

This thesis is a historical analysis of the IMF's intervention
in Korea during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The Asian
Financial Crisis was the worst economic crisis Indonesia,
Thailand, and South Korea experienced since being formally
liberated, overtaking even the 2008 global economic crisis in
severity and scope. 

Despite being a history, my main contribution is not an
unveilment of a series of events of the crisis, but instead a
analysis of the discursive relations through which the crisis
is understood and used. I argue that the IMF's treatment of the
crisis is more than an economic intervention and instead pushes
the world into a recapitulated racial order. Through the
delegation of blame, through the policies prescribed, through
diplomatic relations with debtor countries, and through the
post-crisis analysis, the IMF is able to elevate the world of
Western creditors while denigrating those who depend on them.
These debtor countries are most relevantly the crisis-ridden
countries in Asia, but through comparison with other countries
and other crises, the IMF is able to construct a hierarchy in
which the entire globe takes part and the IMF watches over. In
doing so, the IMF brings forth racial categories of empires
past, congratulating some countries as "models" for others,
others as "acceptable," and all debtors as having experienced
crises because they had not yet progressed to the level of the
successful countries that served as creditors.

In this argument, I draw from scholars of the Marxist strain of
dependency theory, and expand on the common conception of
dependency as material to encompass dependency as an
epistemelogical relation. [expand later] To similarly argue for
the congruence of material and social functions of contemporary
capital, I draw from scholars of traditional Marxist traditions
like Rosa Luxemburg, John Smith, and David Harvey, and more
directly from scholars of racial capitalism like Paula
Chakravartty, Denise Ferreira da Silva, and others.
