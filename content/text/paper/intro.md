# Introduction

Since its founding in 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has
amassed a total of 705 billion Special Drawing Rights in spending
capacity, or about \$1 trillion. This spending capacity is deployed as
loans during times of crisis, compared to the World Bank's extensive
general lending system. Through these loans, relatively small
Washington-based organization (of only \~2,300 staff members) with no
subsidiary organizations is able to move the global economy, millions
of people at a time. Its focus on low-to-middle-income countries
during crises means that the most vulnerable of the global population
are affected by its work.

This thesis is a historical analysis of the IMF's intervention in
Korea during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.

The IMF's loans are not without caveats. Under the stated purpose of
ensuring loan repayment and financial stability, or "conditionality,"
the IMF requires that loan-receiving countries also implement a set of
macroeconomic policy reforms known as Structural Adjustment Programs
(SAPs). These include "purely" economic measures like currency
devaluation, austerity measures, and restructuring or refinancing
foreign debts, but also include liberalization of markets broadly,
privatization of state-owned companies in particular, opening the
country to foreign investment, and a stipulation for the country to
move towards resource extraction and export. Although the majority of
IMF loans do come with market-rate interest rates and often require
collateral, both of which can be a significant burden for countries
requesting aid, SAPs are far more powerful in terms of creating
long-term subjugating economic relations. SAPs push countries in the
Global South to cheaply produce and export goods to the Global North,
where only then they are realized as profit.[This is the main subject
of @smithImperialismTwentyFirstCentury2016] SAPs push countries to
denationalize basic necessities and turn them over to multinational
corporations in order to qualify for loans.[See
@ciafoneEndowingNeoliberalUniversity2005 for a detailed history on
Yale's relationship with privatizing Indonesian power.] In more direct
terms, SAPs push countries into a recapitulated racial hierarchy, a
new imperialism, an imperialism for the twenty-first
century.[@harveyNewImperialism2003;

This literature review summarizes prior research and the theoretical
background for this argument. I begin with a description of capital
accumulation and accumulation by dispossession as described by Marx,
Rosa Luxemburg, and David Harvey. I then contrast more recent theories
on this topic from Denise Ferreira da Silva, Paula Chakravartty, and
several others that attempt to further theorize the social and racial
and its role in capitalism. I provide a complement to this perspective
from the other strands of dependency theory and world-systems
analysis, and describe how my thesis attempts to bring these theories
together. To explain the context these theories will be applied in, I
will then describe existing work on the IMF and associated global
financial bodies like the World Bank. Finally, I will briefly
summarize work in Korean history and note how historical perspectives
are useful to understanding the IMF's role in Korea.
