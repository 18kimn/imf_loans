# synthesis

- financial crisis are external debt crises first and foremost

sigh i dont think i like this paper much for two reasons

- it tries to create an all-encompassing set of abstract models
  for two centuries' worth of crises
- it pins it fundamentally on arrogance and ignorance that
  "financial crises happen to other people at other times in
  other places"... not the historical conditions that lead to
  such crises, and international power relations that depend on
  them
