this book seems to have been written during the 80s debt
crisis, and is about the previous century of
colonial-postcolonial debt crises

- loan boom of 1822-25, debt that followed
- expansion of the 60s and 70s, and world depression of 73
- loan boom of 1920s, great depression of 30s

major conclusions (from intro and conclusions):

- "The Latin American propertied classes and the foreign
  bankers were the principal protagonists and the main
  beneficiaries of the international loan business."

- "Secrecy is one of the perogatives of power, and control over
  information related to public credit is an instrument of
  enormous usefulness for those in power."
