- 1970s
  - brazil argentina mexico borrow lots of money for
    industrialization
  - creditors provide loans because economies going up
  - mexico (and other oil-rich countries) thought that oil
    would go up and borrowed accordingly (aka thought they
    would have enough to pay back) from private banks (e.g. not
    world bank)
  -
- 1973-1974 and 1979-80 oil shocks greatly increased price of
  oil, so lots of money flowed into oil countries, but non-oil
  exporters had high trade deficits.
  - these were deposited in US banks in US dollars
  - banks invested that money in countries with "good" growth
    prospects, in national governments, which seemed safe
- 1970 - 1978 - 1982 = 29b- 159b - 327b
- 1975-1983 latin america quadruples debt 75b->315b
- things started to fall in recession
- american fed raised interest rates cause economic shock
  - paul volcker's anti-inflation campaign
  - highly indebted countries received shock, because their
    debt rose in value (because dollar interest rates rose),
    and their exports fell in value because of the global
    recession
- mexico declares moratorium in august 1982, crisis escalates

  - jesus silva herzog, debt at the time was ~80b
  - look for transcripts from july 1982 federal open market
    committee meeting
    - If a country has enough real resources to generate the
      foreign exchange to service its debts but faces a
      temporary inability to convert resources into foreign
      exchange, then it faces a liquidity crisis; without
      sufficient real resources, it faces a solvency crisis. In
      that strict sense, none of the heavily indebted Latin
      American countries ever faced a solvency crisis in the
      1980s.

- IMF intervention
  - Baker plan: adjustment
  - budget vcuts and low credit growth = macroeconomic =
    absorption
  - deregulation, privatization, liberalization of trade =
    structural = private supply response

- sachs

  - says imf acted on behalf of creditors

- IMF goal was to provide just enough liquidity to get going
  and then use adjustment programs to have the rest be paid
  back
- 1989: nicholas brady (us treasury secretary) proposes
  reduction in loans, and US banks forgive abt 61b or a third
  of total debt
  - Brady plan to service remaining debt

post-crisis

- many sub-saharan african countries could not escape from the
  debt trap and had to get debt relief several times
- HIPCs initiative launched to forgive debt and use it for
  poverty reduction (1999)
  - comprehensive development framework - this author says this
    was discredited (1998)
  - poverty reduction strategy paper (1999(9
