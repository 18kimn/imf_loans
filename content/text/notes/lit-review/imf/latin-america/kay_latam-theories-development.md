quotes a modernization sociologst (nash 1963):

> The West (taken here as the Atlantic community of

this author believes that the debates between **victor raul
haya de la torre** and **jose carlos mariategui** were
useful for intellectual groundwork, in the 1920s-30s.

Haya de la torre believed that you can't skip the historical
stages of development and go straight to socialism

Mariategui, "Latin American Gramsci," saw 1) fedual and
capitalist as part of a single system, esp in latin america,
and 2) didnt see the need for going through with the
capitalist stages of development in order for the

- structuralism - emphasis on state as an actor and
  preventor of change. state capitalism would be able to
  achieve independence from private and foreign ? interests
- internal colonialism - emphasis on indigenous population,
  indigenous history, and how revolution must begin by
  decolonizatoin
- marginality - incorporates what this author calls
  shanty-town dwellers, as a major and unignorable social
  force
  - I have a feeling this author respects but doesn't really
    understand or ...really respect these two schools
- dependency
  - structuralist _dependistas_ take on the above two to
    assert that non-incorporated/non-integrated sectors have
    to lead revolutions since all others will favor reforms
    - how is this structuralist ? lmao
  - orthodox marxists believe in alliance between bourgeois
    and peasantry to transition first to capitalism
  - neo-marxist dependistas emphasize worker-peasant
    alliance for a socialist revolution, which makes sense
