title: The Latin American Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective
author: Jose Antonio ocampo
---

# synthesis

- some statistics saying the crisis was particularly bad
- differs from previous in how external debt was handled -- no
  defaulting, plus large debt ratios
- the international economy progressed in developing large structures
  to manage the economy, but progress here meant saving the US banks
  from a potential crisis and locking latin american nations into
  loans that brought the crisis to over a quarter century

> This inflow of capital has the additional consequence of leading to
> real exchange rate appreciation that compromises export growth.
> Eventually, these policies promoted trade account deficits that, for
> a while, were able to be financed by the already mentioned
> availability of loans coming from international banks based in the
> US and other countries.

-- critique saying that liberalized countries had bad domestic policy

Jose Antonio Ocampo argues that

- crisis was worse than others (see chart 2.1.1) in all of currency,
  external debt, gdp, and banking
  - interesting y-axis choice lmao (country-years)
  - pg 107 - poverty increased from 40.5 to 48.3%
- differs from other crises in how external debt was treated --
- from the great depression, whether it was defaulted or continually
  rescheduled/piled on
- from the great recession, whether they had good debt ratios to begin
  with

- imf backed a "creditor's cartel and forced latina merica to adopt
  strongly contractionary macroeconomic policies" (91)
  - contrasts with criticism of state-led industrialization models
    (which came from both the right and left)
- "fiscal, external and savings gaps remained latent in most countries
  in the absence of any external financing, and led to inflationary
  spurts in only a few countries" e.g. these weren't the cause of a
  gigantic recession since they were happening for a while
- argues that postwar external financing was modest until mid-60s +
  70s

- steep increase in interest rates from US (and the resulting shock)
  is for this author the sort of biggest immediate factor
- argues that bankers were able to deal with credit separately and
  without any unified policy to turn profit on every one

# pointers

- there's a debate re:state-led industrialization as a cause of the
  crisis
- diaz-alejandro 1988 p310 - what could have been a serious but
  manageable recession has turned intoa major development crisis
  unprecedented....mainly because of the breakdown in international
  financial markets and an abrupot change in conditions and rules for
  international lending
- what were the SAPs conditions in this crisis? need to find
