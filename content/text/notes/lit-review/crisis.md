- 1980s-90s: buildup

  - financial institutions freed from lending restrictions
    - speculative real estate investment began by domestic
      banks
    - they needed to finance that investment so they borrowed
      from overseas
    - overseas banks thought that was fine, that these banks
      wouldn't fail because of strong governments, and
      curtailed risks with more short-term loans
    - domestic banks thought these short-term loans would just
      be rolled over as usual
    - high domestic interest rates needed to get foreign
      investment
    - higher interest rates meant domestic currency values went
      down
    - many clients were already unable to service their debts,
      making banks desperate for profits and thus grabbing more
      risky investments
    - liquidity had to be increased by depleting reserves
      (pumping money into the economy) and speculators attacked
      (left as soon as they saw reserves depleted)
    - international banks stopped financing, then domestic
      banks, then crisis in countries even without the problem
      as severe as thailand and indonesia, like hong kong and
      taiwan
  - thailand received many congratulatory remarks from the IMF,
    and some words of caution on the peg to the US dollar -
    according to boughton the fund began moving towards
    structural issues at the end of 1996

  - amnuay vivaran - deputy prime minister at the time --
    resigns on june 19
  - chavalay doesnt want to devalue through all of the first
    half of '97
  - friday, june 27, 1997 -- thailand announces the government
    will be taking control of 16 of the largest finance
    companies
  - and devaluing would hurt the thai baht even further because
    it let the currency drop precipitously in value after
    speculative attack
  - fischer gives a small statement supporting their decisioin

    - november 13, 1997 - camdessus (managing director) indicts
      thailand's "nontransparency" and path to success
      https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/spmds9716

  - fund itself was divided on whether to shutter thai banks
    26For an example of the case against the deposit guarantee,
    see memorandum from Joaquin Ferrán (Deputy Director, Policy
    Development and Review Department) to Neiss, “Thailand—
    LOI” (August 4, 1997); IMF archives, Historian’s files.
  - fund eventually agreed to lend $4 billion and partnering
    banks would donate $12 billion
  - chavailt (prime minister) resigns in november 97 nad
    dissolves his cabinet, chuan leekpai takes his place and
    promises to have stringent austerity programs
    - imf itself says at the beginning of 1998 that the
      austerity programs it had were too stringent
  - the exact reforms that were imposed were really indonesia

- suharto era in the 1960s to present = good standing with IMF

  - suharto was anticommunist dictator lmao

- _korea_

  - four decades of dictatorship left behind with 1987
    democratization
  - 1988 olympics
  - world bank borrower status left in 1995
  -
  - january 23, 1997 - hanbo steel industry declares bankruptcy
  - bribery, large bank loans -> foreign confidence decreased
  - oecd - liberalizing capital flows
  - foreigners believed government was guaranteeing bad loans
    which comprised some 20 percent of total loans
    - aka insolvency problems
  - late august 1997 - government says they'll guaarantee 20
    billion of external debts of korean banks
  - IMF was publicly very reassuring about korea's debt
    problems
  - taiwan dollar floated on october 17, hong kong stock market
    sell off in october 23
  - 6 of 30 largest companies declare bankruptcy by october
    1997, standard and poor downgrades korean sovereign debt
  - $30 billion had been borrowed to fund domestic corrps
  - november 1997 - kang wants to arrange secret meeting with
    camdessus to get him to stay. Kim (ambassador) speaks to
    Camdessus in a corridor during a dinnner and camdessus says
    yes lol
  - camdessus estimates that korea would run out of reserves by
    december, as they ahve ~$25 billion in reserves and $6
    billion in forward commitments, and that $10-15b in loans
    wouldn't be rolled over
  - young sam kim (president) puts in chang-yuel lim (former
    alternate executive director at imf) to replace kyong shik
    kang

  - imf in washingotn prepares to make deal
    - interest rates - profitability of businesses would fall
      and more bankruptcies would occur if raised, not raising
      would keep capital flight.
    - should creditors increase their exposure?
  - PLAYERS

    - kyong shik kang - korean finance minister in 1997
    - kihwan kim - ambassador at large

  - clinton phones young sam kim to urge reforms
  - the problem was seen as psychological (investor confidence)

- **hedging** -- protecting an investment by taking a position
  in the opposite direction (a bit like insurance)

- 1990s: speculation
- 1997: crisis and intervention
- western governments insisted that asian governments were
  corrupt and full of crony capitalism (see furman and stiglitz
  1998), which led to decrease in investor confidence
- look at lane et al 1999 - foreign analysts saw the crisis as
  resulting from financial sector instabilities rather than
  exterior rpractices
- IMF didn't recognize it was a capital account crisis, which
  it later acknowleded (imf 2003 ? )
- banks only joined when US government was willing to be lender
  of last resort (bailout if needed), e.g. IMF did not serve
  that role either because it didnt want to or because it
  couldnt

- THE MONEY / LOAN AMOUNTS
  - $55 billion total
    - 21 from imf
    - 10 from world bank
    - 4 from asian development bank
    - 20 billion from twelve other nations' banks
- THE ACTUAL REFORMS

  - the money itself was important but not that important

    - only a "small" amount was available at first
    - foreign confidence
    - "structural problems"

  - FISCAL AUSTERITY
  - STRUCTURAL REFORM

- THE KOREAN RESPONSE

  - LOSS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT (due to fiscal austerity)
  - GOLD COLLECTING CAMPAIGN
  -

- the reforms were useless
  - IMF reforms (as signaled by s&p ratings) only finalized at
    the end of 1999, after the actual crisis
  - the scope of reforms was too broad to be implementable
  - no proof behind any measure

those reforms:

- look at goldstein 2003 for discussion on crisis
  conditionality
- and at branson and hanna 2000 for specific to asia crisis

- structural reform measures despite capital account crisis
  (not insolvency)
  - short-term problems of structural reform (aka discipline)
    may have prolonged the crisis
- high interest rate policy

- dispossession

  - miracle of the han river

    - see also "east asian miracle" and "asian tiger"
    - configured korea's success as something beyond reason and
      outside of logic; something supernatural, given the
      preconception of asian countries as economically (and
      every other way too, but here economically) inferior
      - alice amsden being a top proponent of this narrative
      - to use the language of da silva, it requires improper
        economic subjects that don't fit traditional rules of
        debtor-creditor (e.g. when the debt can actually be
        paid back)
      -
    - violent suppression for economic success is ... ? how to
      explain ?
      - is this seen as necessary or as incomprehensible?
      - the narrative of the miracles obscures the violence
        through which these economic successes actually occured

  - crisis
    - was necessary to view the miracle as exactly that -- a
      miracle
    - reinforces the narrative with material results
    - but the crisis itself came from speculation and discourse
      itself
    -
  - race on a national scale
    - to look towards race as a social category operating at
      many different scales, in addition to the commonly (more
      than commonly... to the masses, outwardly ? ) understood
      functions of race as a set of psychological biases
  - model minority <-> model modernity

  - kim dae-jung

    - historical explanation is that he, as a liberal, was
      opposed to the conservative nationalists of the time that
      prided themselves on the _chaebol_ systems. When the IMF
      indicted those large corporations, that was aligned with
      him politically
    - that explanation feels circumstance, though, rather than
      a deeper moral opposition...like why couldn't he be
      opposed simultaneously to the conservative groups and the
      IMF-imposed policies? I'm hoping to argue it was because
      this was unthinkable for him; in his eyes freedom
      socially meant following the path of the West, meaning a
      liberal notion of freedom that relied on keeping the
      government out of the free market etc.

- nationalist interest in korean development might have aligned
- presidents often have little power
  - coerced to go along with state machinery
  - the state
  - individuals have limited power
- cpaitalism and global forces move them to their own ends

- harry white - communist/ not communist
  - imf policies come from race
    - straightforward enough to say because you can sort of
      unpack the motivations and the roles used as suggested by
      the language of their memos and meeting notes
- imf policies produce and reinforce race
  - one argument im going to use is that the imf was able to
    point towards the rapid recovery as
  - difficult to see exactly how to justify this
- specialist in korean politics
