> Ultimately, I argue that race and comedy share formal qualities for producing meaning in the world—excess, ambiguity, and repetition—to advance two objectives. First, I explain the challenges that these formal similarities between comedy and race have posed to race and ethnic studies and how and why that has limited scholarly investigation. To understand form in this context is to better grasp why race and comedy have been such a provocative and often explosive pairing. Second, I aim to begin to imagine the critical possibilities that arise when the comic structure of race becomes the analytical emphasis.
