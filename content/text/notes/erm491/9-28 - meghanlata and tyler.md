    sources, ...

    copy+pasted essentially into final thesis
    - dont be afraid to "steal from yourself"
    - don't be afraid to talk to people (talking to friends and

      - keeping an open mind to what might change is usef

methods

- interdisciplinary vs multidisciplinary - synthesis,
  continuous vs discrete
- narrowing down topic will help a lot with this by focusing
  detail and thus showing what explorations are open to
  interdisciplinary analysis
- for myself, integration areas arE:
  - statistics/viz and text/literature analysis
  - economics and ethnic studies
- archives
  - are ephemeral â€” not institutionalized as an archive
  - for me, git repos

prospectus - 5 pages
