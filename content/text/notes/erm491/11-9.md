what if there's no gap in the lit review? 

I'm not a professor, but if i were, the advice i would offer is

- strategic topics. Korea is pretty strategic because it's both important and not-that-important to US scholars, so writing about it has value but not a lot of people have written about it
- get another set of eyes. Summarize everything you've read so far to a close friend and ask them for thoughts. They don't need to know the field of study or even be a humanities person etc. Just another brain of any kind is great
- Do a few freewrite exercises where you recombine words from thesis statements. Instead of racial logic, do gendered logic or racial labor roles or something. Instead of global logic of capitalism, do low-level (low as in local) analyses of grassroots resistance
