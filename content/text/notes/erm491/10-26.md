1.  claim
    
    south korea is model modernity. imf does just as much to enforce the stability of a social and racial hierarchy as it does an economic one
    
2.  reasons
    
3.  evidence
    
    -   quick bailout, congratualting for repayment
    -   post/colonial relationships
    
4.  other povs
    
    -   korea needs imf
    -   imf needed to act fast (can't do full study)
    -   good for global economy that korea was opened up and made more fiscally secure
    
    my answer: doesn't really matter
    
    -   for all of these points, it doesnt change the fact that the IMF restricted its autonomy/sovereignty through foreign investment and dependency
    -   if korea needs the imf, that too is an issue of economic sovereignty
    -   if the imf needed to act fast and so just used the default approach, then that's bad too (the IMF shouldn't by default require countries to
