Korea received a loan from the IMF in December of 1997 and
repaid it by 2001, earlier than the required deadline of 2005.
Managing Director Horst Kohler congratulated South Korea for
this in the above document. Kohler specifically notes that the
relationship between the IMF and Korea "has been exemplary and
in many respects serves as a model for other countries," which
is fairly interesting given the mass protests in South Korea to
IMF takeover and the criticism of then-President Kim Dae-Jung
of opening the economy for foreign investment. It also quite
explicitly characterizing the relationship I noted in my
project proposal of Korea as a nation of "model modernity."
Through statements like these, Korea is made into an ideal to
which other developing nations can aspire to, and upon failure
this standard can be used to castigate those nations.

This is another resource from the IMF, a short memo from the
Executive Board Meeting of the IMF in August 2nd, 2002. The
memo specifically covers the recovery of Thailand, in which the
crisis began and was one of the hardest-hit countries. This
source serves as a comparison point in showing that the IMF
staff definitely use much tamer language to describe the crisis
in Thailand than in South Korea, i.e. South Korea's situation
is a "model" but Thailand is simply "acceptable." But this
source individually doesn't offer as much for my theoretical
argument compared to the above source. For the most part, I
hope to use many sources like these to gain context and
quotable figures to use in my thesis.

This is an example of a resource from the Korean national
archives, from the "IMF era" that stretched roughly from
1998-2005. Most of the writing here is fairly technical
material that discusses policy changes made after
December 1997. There are sections of the report that note with
some caution the increasing proportion of foreign-held bonds,
and the introduction does have a patriotic turn by discussing
the duty of the Economic Bureau to serve the nation of South
Korea. But in general, this is a statistical report that is I
think will be necessary for my project (to actually tell the
events and details of the financial crisis), but is not wholly
central for my theoretical arguments. Tangentially, resources
like these made me realize I need to spend some time setting up
a hosting platform, an OCR tool, and a translation tool to go
through these texts much more quickly.

This is one of many issues archived by the Naver News

South Korea, in that it is a tech company that does a billion
different things but mostly makes profits from ads.] from the
Chosun Ilbo, which is one of the leading newspapers in the
country and the oldest daily newspaper of Korea. Newspapers
like these will complement the administrative records of the
IMF and Korean government to provide a glimpse of Korean
society in the Asian financial crisis. One snippet from the
December 4th, 1997 issue of the Chosun Ilbo is shown below.
This issue was released one day after the IMF loan agreement
was signed, and the main headline reads "$550 Billion Loan
Package Approved." The main text of this article is wholly
approving of the IMF. It also includes a few words of praise
for President Kim Dae-Jung, which is unexpected given the
Chosun Ilbo's conservative leaning and Kim Dae-Jung's famous
(left) activist background (he was even kidnapped by the Korean
CIA and imprisoned for five years for protesting right-wing
dictator Park Chung Hee).

Bruce Cumings' _Origins of the Korean War_ is a foundational
text in academic studies of the Korean Peninsula. At the time
of its publication, the mainstream narrative of the Korean War
assumed that it began with North Korea invading South Korea in
1950 in a near-unprovoked attack. Cumings pushed back on this
by arguing that 1) the War really began with the arbitrary
separation of the Korean peninsula by the U.S. in 1945, and 2)
violence of the Korean War did not begin in 1950, because of
cross-border fighting and uncountably many lives lost from
massacres in South Korea by the South Korean and U.S. armies.
This narrative was a revisionist one that was treated with
skepticism by other scholars of Korea, but due to his sheer
massive amount of research it has made its way into the canon
of Korean history.^[Actually massive! The first volume of
_Origins_ is some 600 pages and the second is almost 1000
pages. He also published many more histories of Korea after
this.] I don't actually plan on talking much about the Korean
War in my thesis, given that the majority of its fighting
occurred fifty years before the Asian financial crisis, but I
do hope to use Cumings' arguments as starting points or
"givens" for my analyses. South Korea was from the start born
from U.S. violence and its position in the global political
economy in 1998 would have been very different had not the
United States assisted in massacres of activists fighting for
economic egalitarianism in the 1940s and 50s.^[Addendum: I like
Bruce Cumings a lot as a scholar for this kind of perspective
and work. Professor Ria Chae gave a comparison last year of
Cumings to Carter Eckert, another famous/foundational scholar
of Korean history in the United States. They're both very
successful academically, having endowed chairs at the
University of Chicago and Harvard. And both began their
interest in Korea from being deployed to Korea as part of the
Peace Corps draft. But while Carter Eckert mostly stuck to his
duties, Cumings often left his post to join protestors of
then-dictator Park Chung Hee and hosted organizers in his home.
He was also an early member of the Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars that was formed in opposition to the U.S. war in
Vietnam and in solidarity with liberation movements of the
Third World. A lot of this personal history is reflected in the
kind of history he writes, which seeks to deconstruct U.S.
aggression and highlight Korean resistance to this aggression.
Not to idolize a tenured white male scholar, but yes, I hope my
own study is on a trajectory closer to Cumings' than Eckert's.]

Seungsook Moon's _Militarized Modernity_ is another text in contemporary history
of Korea, discussing gender in South Korean society in the 1980s and early
1990s. She explores gender as a state project, focusing on South Korea's "draft
culture" and how gender divides are reified and seen as necessary for state
security. The draft for men (or some idea of "men") was seen as necessary and
has never been seriously challenged, and South Korean society uses this position
to give special benefits for men in the workplace as "rewards" for going through
the draft. This also heightened the gender divide as women were pushed into
factory jobs while men were often given managerial work. Feminists and labor
union activists fought against this. This issue was central to the 1987 "June
Struggle" that led to what is now acknowledged as the formal democratization of
South Korea. Moon, centers her study on the years immediately before and after
South Korea's "democratization" in 1987. Like Cumings' work, this is not exactly
my period of study, but I hope to use her arguments as starting points for my
own. She also has a higher emphasis on interviews and almost ethnographic data
(she lived through this era), allowing her not only to deconstruct high-level
state reports but also how individual people felt about the draft and gender. I
hope to extend this analysis of the _culture_ of the South Korean economy in my
own work.

David Harvey's _The New Imperialism_, and especially the third
chapter "Accumulation by Dispossession", is a major theoretical
departure point for my thesis and a touchstone for contemporary
American studies. He extends Rosa Luxemburg's and Marx's view
of capital accumulation and primitive accumulation to the
contemporary age. Luxemburg and Marx argued that capitalism
fundamentally must expand and continue to grow in a process
known as _primitive accumulation_, and points where it cannot
grow due to a lack of resources results in a crisis as
"bubbles" pop and capitalist economies reorganize themselves.
Marx also argued that this process is nowhere near "natural"
and has its beginnings in truly violent actions like land
appropriation, war, colonialism, and slavery that led to
"differences" in economic capital. Harvey combines these two
views for the neoliberal age to argue that capitalism today not
only relies on violence at its beginning (as "primitive"
accumulation might suggest), but is continually violent because
it constantly expands and collapses in on itself to support
itself in the neoliberal age. To say it in another way, capital
accumulation is not only a process of economic violence, but
also of social and physical violence. He terms this
_accumulation by dispossession_.

This is another one of those texts that is near-impossible to
talk about in studies of neoliberal economics, but it's
especially relevant to my thesis because of Da Silva and
Chakravartty's critique of it, as explored below.

Da Silva and Chakravartty acknowledge Harvey's study as a
foundational and necessary one, but critique it for its
treatment of race in accumulation by dispossession. Harvey only
notes the disproportionate impact of accumulation by
dispossession on people of color, almost treating race as a
coincidental axis along which economic consequences occur.
Ironically, even as he tries to push back on the violence of
"primitive accumulation" as only occuring at the early stages
of capitalist economies, he relegates race to a "primitive"
status which modern capitalist forces use to function. Da Silva
and Chakravartty push back on this by exploring how race and
accumulation by dispossession co-constitute each other, and the
violence that creates race is the same violence that leads to
capital accumulation.

My thesis in turn acknowledges their view as generative but
still incomplete. While framed as a study of global capitalism
and arguing that "race as the _naturalized_ ways U.S. Americans
deploy the term cannot be the privileged and sole critical
descriptor" of the various manifestations of the logics of
dispossession on the "others of Europe," still stops short of
studying dispossession across the globe. Their collection does
not touch on relationships between or across nations,
institutions that drive these processes forth, or how the
crises they discuss manifest elsewhere. My project will attempt
to complement to their discussion by discussing debt and
raciality as global concepts. This turn in scope will also
hopefully focus on other areas they touch on but ultimately do
not explore -- the role of the colony/postcolony/colonizer, and
the role of racial logic in globalization.

Barry Eichengreen's book discusses the history of the dollar
(or what some refer to as "dollar hegemony") in the 20th
century. The term "exorbitant privilege" comes from the former
French Minster of Finance Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who was
criticizing the U.S.' control of the international reserve
system. Because the U.S. was a political and economic
powerhouse after World War II, it was able to insist on the
American dollar being pegged to gold at the Bretton Woods
conference in 1944 that established the IMF. Other countries
had to deal in either gold or the dollar. This was meant to
move the global economy away from just gold, but in reality
this position gave the U.S. an undisputed financial ruling
position, codified into international law until the Nixon shock
actions of 1971. This allowed the U.S. to simply print more
dollars in cases of financial crisis that required foreign
assistance, while other countries had to make one thousand more
chairs or loaves of bread and so on to gather the same amount
of funds. Today, although the Nixon shock ended that system,
the U.S. dollar holds incredible power.^[One interesting
example occurred in 2016 with the French bank BNP Paribas, for
dealings with the U.S.-sanctioned countries Cuba, Sudan, and
Iran. BNP Paribas faced a fine of $9 billion, the largest fine
ever against a bank; such a fine from the United States was
only possible because international banks must deal in the
dollar currency to remain viable. It's ridiculous to me that
the U.S. could enforce its own sanctions by punishing a bank
from another country, because of its financial power. See Neil
Irwin, “In BNP Paribas Case, an Example of How Mighty the
Dollar Is,” The New York Times, July 1, 2014, sec. The Upshot,
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/upshot/the-dollars-big-role-in-foreign-policy.html.
]

My paper is not about the "dollar hegemony," but I do feel like
the IMF's role in enforcing this through its reserve funds is
important history to note in my background.

This resource provides a good overview on the history of the
IMF leading up to the crisis, but it will be most useful for me
for its discussion on South Korea and policies of
conditionality that the IMF imposed. It criticizes the IMF for
using a "Mexico-style" bailout in Korea, meaning the fiscal
reforms applied were those of tightening debt, closing banks,
requiring existing banks to be put up for foreign takeover. The
IMF even required Korea to open its domestic market to Japanese
cars and other products, which the Korean government had been
in staunch opposition of due to Japan's war crimes and colonial
oppression in the first half of the 20th century. It's also
practically useful for me as I am still in the beginning of the
research process, because it's an English-language source
specific to Korea's involvement, and has tons of citations I
can follow with lengthyl footnotes that add commentary on each.

This is probably one of the more interesting secondary sources
I'll use for this project. David Martin-Jones analyzes the
South Korean films _Calla_, _Ditto_, and _2009: Lost Memories_
in this article, which are all produced in the so-called "IMF
era" of 1997-2002. All three of these films involve time travel
from present to past (also in the future, for _2009_), giving
chances for historical reflection and commentary. Martin-Jones
argues that though South Korea has experienced a "compressed
modernity" period from rapid development in the late 20th
century, the financial crisis of 1997 induced a sudden "pause"
in development^[A really large euphemism here, given millions
of people lost their jobs.] akin to the pause for reflection
allowed by time travel at the center of these films. Topics of
reflection stretch from gender roles and laws around
gender-based employment, to new technology, to the independence
of the youth. These are all used to push a sort of new
conservatism and chastise the younger generation, a pattern
that Martin-Jones argues took hold during the ambiguity of the
IMF crisis.

I'm not actually sure if I buy his argument yet, as the
specific relationship of the IMF involvement with Korea is sort
of justified with a hand-wavy explanation. I still hope to use
this article and the sources he mentions to study culture
surrounding the IMF economic crisis.
