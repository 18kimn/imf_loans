## Introduction

### Background

Since its founding in 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has amassed a
total of 705 billion Special Drawing Rights in spending capacity, or about \$1
trillion. As opposed to the World Bank's extensive general lending system, IMF
loans have played a pivotal role specifically during times of crisis. The
relatively small Washington-based organization (of only \~2,300 staff members)
with no subsidiary organizations is able to move the global economy through
these loans, millions of people at a time. Its focus on low-to-middle-income
countries during crises means that the most vulnerable of the global population
are affected by its work.

The IMF's loans are not without caveats. Under the stated purpose of ensuring
loan repayment and financial stability, or "conditionality," the IMF requires
that loan-receiving countries also implement a set of macroeconomic policy
reforms known as Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs). These include "purely"
economic measures like currency devaluation, austerity measures, and
restructuring or refinancing foreign debts, but also include liberalization of
markets broadly, privatization of state-owned companies in particular, opening
the country to foreign investment, and most relevantly to this project, a
stipulation for the country to move towards resource extraction and export.
Although the majority of IMF loans do come with market-rate interest rates and
often require collateral, both of which can be a significant burden for
countries requesting aid, SAPs are far more powerful in terms of creating
long-term subjugating economic relations. SAPs push countries in the Global
South to cheaply produce and export goods to the Global North, where only then
they are realized as profit.[This is the main subject of
@smithImperialismTwentyFirstCentury2016] SAPs push countries to denationalize
basic necessities and turn them over to multinational corporations in order to
qualify for loans.[See @ciafoneEndowingNeoliberalUniversity2005 for a detailed
history on Yale's relationship with privatizing Indonesian power.] In more
direct terms, SAPs push countries into a recapitulated racial hierarchy, a new
imperialism, an imperialism for the twenty-first
century.[@harveyNewImperialism2003; @smithImperialismTwentyFirstCentury2016]

### My project

My project seeks to explore the racial logic embedded in SAPs, rejecting the
exterior colorblindness of contemporary financial loans by questioning the
racial assumptions they make and the world-reordering consequences they bring
forth.

This will begin with Paula Chakravartty and Denise da Silva's collection _Race,
Empire, and the Crisis of the
Subprime_.[@chakravarttyAccumulationDispossessionDebt2012a] They note that while
Marxist geographer David Harvey's theory of _accumulation by dispossession_
emphasizes the social processes of dispossession that are at capitalism's core,
Harvey takes race for granted in his writing because he notes simply the
disproportionate burden of these acts of dispossession on people of color. He
stops short of discussing the racial logic that would allow such a burden to
appear. Thus, even while criticizing the burden of the economic impact on people
of color, race and racism are taken as "primitive" or preexisting concepts over
which modern capitalist forces take hold. Da Silva and Chakravartty push back on
this and argue that race continues to order accumulation in and of itself, and
specifically in the subprime mortgage crisis that Black recipients of loans are
_continually_ configured to be outside of the relationship of an economic
transaction and the capacity to pay one side of the trade.[See also
@silvaGlobalIdeaRace for more from da Silva on this topic.]

But their discussion, while framed as a study of global capitalism and arguing
that "race as the _naturalized_ ways U.S. Americans deploy the term cannot be
the privileged and sole critical descriptor" of the various manifestations of
the logics of dispossession on the "others of Europe," still stops short of
studying dispossession across the globe. Their collection does not touch on
relationships between or across nations, institutions that drive these processes
forth, or how the crises they discuss manifest elsewhere. My project will
attempt to complement to their discussion by discussing debt and raciality as
global concepts. While Chakravartty and da Silva focus on U.S. banking
institutions and the subprime mortgage loan, I will focus on the IMF's crisis
loans; while they critique the dispossession of the "others of Europe" by
focusing on Black and Latino/a homeowners, I will focus on the (mis)handling of
the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and as a case study focus on the crisis'
escalation to catastrophe in South Korea.

South Korea is relevant for a number of reasons. It was under the rule of four
different states over the past one hundred and fifty years, was destroyed by war
and four decades of dictatorship after its supposed "liberation" from Japan, and
was separated arbitrarily from its northern half by the whim of two U.S. Navy
Officers.^[Some useful thinkers here are @chang2015; @cho2008; and @cumings2002]
Yet today the nation enjoys a sort of "model modernity" status of postindustrial
success.^[While the term "model modernity" was said to me by Professor Lowe as a
conversational, on-the-spot insight during an advising meeting, I believe others
have deployed this term as well -- specifically @lye1999; but also @chettri2020
and @wilks2008.] Like the much-discussed myth of Asian Americans as a "model
minority" in the U.S., that status connotes a group that has endured hardship
but ultimately has played by the (Western) rules of capitalist success to
achieve some semblance of "prosperity" today. Not only does this rely on a false
notion of prosperity, for neither the "model minority" Asian Americans nor the
"model modernity" of South Korea are liberated from colonialism today, but the
status also hides how the logic that led to the "success" of certain groups
perpetuates the oppression of others. South Korea has only enjoyed "order"
because Korea has cemented patriarchal norms through draft culture,^[Or
"militarized modernity," as popularized by @moon2005], and it has only enjoyed
"peace" because it sent almost a million troops to Vietnam in exchange for U.S.
capital and technology during the Vietnam War.^[@chang2015] Other countries that
do not experience the same economic

The economic crisis of 1997 exemplifies this dynamic and exposes a momentary
contradiction in the march to capitalist modernity. Before the crisis, South
Korea was boasting record low unemployment rates, had worker's rights and labor
laws that were among the strongest of the OECD group, all with a consistently
low inflation rate and was known for its cautious stance on foreign
investment.^[@cliftIMFPoliticsAusterity2018;
@hwangLongTermImplicationsNeoliberal2015; @kim2001imf] But the unemployment rate
in South Korea quadrupled in less than a year after the crisis began in October
1997, and the IMF quickly transitioned from an obscure international economic
agency into a household name.^[@kim2002; @martin-jones2007; @park1999] The
former face of the new Korean generation and proclaimer of equality, Kim
Dae-Jung, turned an about-face on his belief in protecting the Korean economy
and quickly accepted the IMF's recommendation to put Korea's central banks up
for sale.^[@chossudovsky2000] In other words, the glass image of capitalist
stability was cracked and laid bare, as the IMF quickly opened the South Korean
economy for outside financial institutions to buy up and the labor rights fought
for by unions were reset after company acquisitions. My paper will uncover how
this process was made possible -- what racial and national categories were
present, how _race_ specifically was a relevant category, and why such a
relationship between the IMF and the Korean government did not occur elsewhere
in the world.

More than just being a difference in topic or scope, I hope that this
positioning will enable my project to connect Chakravartty and da Silva's
analysis of the racial logic of debt with postcolonial theory and theories of
globalization. These are undoubtedly concepts that Da Silva and Chakravartty
stretch towards in their collection, and other authors have similarly tried to
bridge the gap between contemporary theories of race and theories of
globalization.^[Some of my favorite ones are @amin2014;
@featherstoneGlobalCultureNationalism1990; @sassen1998; and
@jenkinsBondsInequalityDebt2021, but there is so much insight and work in this
field that cannot fit into a single footnote.] But in my view, very little
literature has questioned the racial categories that give rise to the
"globalized" world of today. Discussion on globalization criticizes the unequal
economic nature and sometimes (like Harvey) notes the disproportionate impact of
this economic burden on people of color, but no theoretical or empirical
discussion has discussed how the racial and economic imbalances are not
coincidental but part of the same fundamental process of capitalist
dispossession. I hope that my thesis can fill this gap.

## Methods

### Format of presentation

I will explore the IMF's processes of dispossession firstly through a paper that
will give a history of the 1997 Asian financial crisis in South Korea and the
IMF's response, focusing on the criteria the IMF uses to approve a loan and the
policies they attach to it. These will mostly come from the IMF archives, found
[here](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Archives), the South Korean government
archives found [here](https://archives.go.kr/english/index.jsp), and South
Korean newspapers from the 1997-2000 years (the "IMF era") hosted
[here](https://newslibrary.naver.com/search/searchByDate.nhn#%7B%22mode%22%3A3%2C%22trans%22%3A1%2C%22pageSize%22%3A20%2C%22date%22%3A%221997-01-01%22%2C%22page%22%3A1%2C%22officeId%22%3A%2200032%22%2C%22fevt%22%3A5976%2C%22publishType%22%3A%2200010%22%7D)

I will explore this secondly in a creative medium, by creating a set of
interactive visualizations of the relationships my paper will discuss. These
will focus on import and export relationships held by loan recipient countries
before and after IMF loans, SAPs' role in investment from former imperial powers
into their formerly colonized countries, and a comparison of criteria used by
the IMF in different geographic contexts. The web page will be a set of
zoomable, clickable, scrollable maps on the global and national-level scales
(i.e. the Korean peninsula). Next to each map will be a sidebar explaining the
story behind each map. The web page will be made with the Vue, d3.js, and Mapbox
GL JS libraries in JavaScript, and data processing will be done through the R
language for statistical computing.

A version of the website in its current (extremely limited) state can be found
at [https://imfdispossession.info](https://imfdispossession.info).

### One note on disciplines

My hope in this approach is to blend methods of presentation that have been
useful to me, but beyond my personal preferences I hope to also unite
disciplinary divides that have frustrated me for the past four years. I consider
this project to be rooted in ethnic studies and cultural studies, because its
main focus will be on cycles of oppression and its contestation by those
directly affected by it. But my project will also incorporate quantitative
(demographic) perspectives from economics and statistics, pushing back on the
implicit notion of the critical as qualitative and conversely the quantitative
as uncritical. To elaborate, the critical theory at the heart of ethnic studies
is usually pursued through purely "qualitative" methods, which leaves much to be
said on how "quantitative" methods of S&DS should be seen as just as subjective,
opinionated, and creative. In other words, numeric and technical methods are
just as full of qualitative components as those methods of history, poem,
memoir, ethnography, and so on that we canonically assign the label of
"qualitative." Both of my double majors of ER&M and S&DS (and perhaps every
major at Yale besides Computing and the Arts) abide by this disciplinary
boundary, to the effect of upholding the binding of "critical" with
"qualitative" and conversely reinforcing the separation of "critical" from
"quantitative."

## Notes on research plan and timeline

The IMF reading rooms are currently closed to external visitors due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Many of their materials are already hosted online and
viewable through the catalog page described above, but it will be difficult to
access the bulk of their resources for the forseeable future. I will work with
the IMF librarians on this point.

The most important scheduling point I should make known is that I hope to study
abroad in South Korea for a year beginning in March of 2022, and have applied
for the Light Fellowship in language study for this purpose. If I receive the
fellowship, I will take a leave of absence from regular studies from January
through December of 2022, and return to work on the thesis and finish my last
semester of Yale in Spring of 2023.
