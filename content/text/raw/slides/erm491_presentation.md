- accumulation requires either 1) more raw material or 2) larger consumer base
- capital 1: 1867
- Marx notes gold and silver taken from America, enslavement and murder of
  indigenous populations in america, the looting of the east indies, the
  transatlantic slave trade, and the forceful expropriation of land from the
  english peasantry to a few landowners

- harvey notes that these processes don't just happen in the primitive sense but

I read some of this stuff last semester, and started thinking through it, and
there were some spots where it could definitely be expanded:

- global nature
- other crises besides 2008
- how does that racial logic function

(history)

- if I had an banana valued at $1 today, but the US dollar is being pumped up in
  value so that tomorrow this price of $1 actually represents $10, nobody will
  want to buy my banana

- model modernity
  - racial hierarchy made this, this makes racial hierarchy
  - universalizing - differentiating

as important as the actual events that led to the crisis actually are, what I am
much more interested in explaining and understanding and making a thesis about
is the logic behind all of this

- if that doesn't make sense, it's because I have no idea what I'm talking about
- pictures sometimes are better than words
